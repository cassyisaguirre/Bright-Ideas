            <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify; color: #666;">Mr. Mercadejas is the one behind the early success of the company despite being new in the industry.
                He continuously brings accomplishment to the company by building branches along the cities and malls that gives
                opportunities to people who need a job.  The idea of making his own publishing company started when he was 16 years
                old where he began to love reading and collecting books.  He was amazed at how the smell of the pages of a new book
                and the sight of shelves filled with books gives relaxation and sanity to him. <br><br>
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify; color: #666;">From that day, he wanted to share and spread the admiration he has for books so he started to build a publishing company
                that will print pages from the author and genre.  He is overwhelmed on how the people loved and appreciated the quality
                they gave to the books people loved and waited to be published.  He had a vision and a goal of bringing the best quality
                books every author and book lover deserved.</p>

                    I have patronized the Expressions Stores in the many places I have stayed or visited for around two decades now.  It has kept improving since then.  The services have become better and better. Almost all of your school and office supplies need are available there. This is the reason why  I have considered this store as my partner, friend, and helper for the longest of my working years as a student. </div>

                    Their stores have become more beautiful and looking for items has become stress - free,  especially for me who always looks for things.  I have asked the store clerks every thing that I  have needed,  and wow!  I have never been disappointed.  The store clerks have found for me many things,  and I  love to hear suggestions why some things are better options. The managers are all willing and ready to serve.</div>

                    You can always express yourself in the cards and other gifts that you buy here mainly because you have all the things to choose from. The best thing is the fact that I Could do my hobbies, and Expressions has provided me all the materials I need for them. Embroidery,  Crochet, painting, bead works, handicrafts,  and many others become more popular once again to the new generations.
